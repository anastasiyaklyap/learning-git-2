            <h1>Taarlo</h1>
            <h3>by Herman De Coninck</h3>
            <p>We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.<br>
                And in spring too I feel no different.<br>
                We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves<br>
                through much dark-red loss, <em>appellation control√©e,</em><br><br>
                that deepens in the cellar of the years.<br>
                We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.<br>
                Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees<br>
                sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.<br><br>
                33, and in the midst of the dark wood<br>
                of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,<br>
                at home in the woods and desolate at home.<br><br>
                Will we one day, maybe, ever?<br>
                The summer is past, the hay-making is over.<br>
                The here is nowhere, and the now is never.<br>
            </p>
